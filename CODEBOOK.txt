CODEBOOK -  for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Project Code Book

This document serves as the code book for the project. It provides essential information on how to access the source data, execute the R script, and understand the variables and transformations applied in the process.

How to Access the Data:

1. Download Data:
   - SET WORKING DIRECTORY - MAKE SURE IT IS THE SAME AS "getwd()" in R 
   - DOWNLOAD PROJECT DATA FOUND ON COURSE WEBSITE - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
   - THIS WILL PUT "getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset.zip" in MyDocuments
   - MOVE "UCI HAR DATASET" FOLDER TO THE WORKING DIRECTORY
   - unzip("UCI HAR Dataset.zip") ## UNZIPS ZIP FILE
   - CREATES "test" folder, "train" folder, and "activity_labels", "features", "features_info", and "READ_ME" text files.

2. Execute the R Script:
   - Run the R script named "run_analysis.R" to perform the necessary operations on the data.

About the Source Data:

The source data for this project originates from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A comprehensive description of the dataset can be found at the official site: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

About the R Script:

The R script, "run_analysis.R", performs the following steps as per the assigned task of the coursework:
1. Data Reading and Merging:
   - Reads the training and testing datasets along with feature vectors and activity labels.
   - Assigns variable names.
   - Merges all data into one dataset.

2. Extracting Relevant Measurements:
   - Selects only the measurements corresponding to mean and standard deviation for each feature.

3. Descriptive Activity Names:
   - Uses descriptive activity names to label the activities in the dataset.

4. Descriptive Variable Names:
   - Appropriately labels the dataset with descriptive variable names.

5. Creating Tidy Data Set:
   - Generates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   - Writes the resulting tidy data set into a text file.

Note: The code assumes that all data files are present in the same folder, uncompressed, and with their original names intact.

## About Variables:

- `x_train`, `y_train`, `x_test`, `y_test`, `subject_train`, and `subject_test` contain data from the downloaded files.
- `x_data`, `y_data`, and `subject_data` merge the above datasets for further analysis.
- `features` contains the correct names for the `x_data` dataset, applied to the column names for detailed reference.

See README text file for more detailed variable description and code for run_analysis.R.
